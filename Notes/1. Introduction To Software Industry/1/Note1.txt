1. JIRA is a project management tool/software. In IT sector the task assignment(who will do which task we will track on through ZIRA) happens through JIRA. The TL/Manager will assign the task to employees through ZIRA software. After login the employee will open the ZIRA software and checks which task he/she needs to do.

2. Maven & Gradle are the build tools that is used to automate the dependencies so that the developers don't need to add the JAR files manually or the developers don't need to add the external JAR files as we downloaded at the time of advanced Java.

3. Git & Bitbucket are the version control software used to store all developers source code at one place. It integrates the source code of all developers.

4. Log monitoring means taking the log file, see the log message, finding problem, go to the project and fix the problem. To connecting one system to another system we need to use Putty/WinSCP/Splunk. they are used to monitor log files.

5. Code coverage means how many lines of code is tested through unit testing.  

6. Code review means whatever the code we are writing there is bug or not, the code is developed through proper coding standard or not, Is there duplicate code available or not, security is properly maintained or not. All the mistakes of developers are identified by SonarQube.

7. Performance testing means if there is multiple users then how our project is responding.
